# TestBugAnalyzer
TestBugAnalyzer is a tool to identify bug reports reporting a test bug in Git repositories. The tool uses JGit to traverse commit tree of all projects in the folder specified by `Settings.projectsPath`. It identifies test commits and production commits. From these two set of commits it identifies bug reports reporting test bugs and production bugs, then it downloads bug reports from the bug repository specified by `Settings.issuesApache` field (In our study it downloads bug reports from Apache Jira server). It also caches a copy of bug report in the folder specified by `Settings.allBugReportPath`. It analyzes bug reports, extracts metrics and reports them as .csv file. `MultipleProjectRunner` class can be used to run variety of third party tools such as FindBugs, PMD, sonarqube and cloc on the projects specified by `Settings.projectsPath`. Finally, `FindBugResultXMLParser` can be used to extract metrics from FindBugs results. To run the tool you need Maven and JDK 1.6+.
